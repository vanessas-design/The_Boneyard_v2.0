Release Notes

Game: The Boneyard
Creator: Vanessa Seymour
Date: January 21, 2021
Version: 2.0
 
New features
	The game now has its own original music!
  o	Composed by Vanessa Seymour on BeepBox

Fixes
	Fixed the ending condition glitch where a player was able to end the game early on accident by interacting with a coffin more than once to collect the required number of bones and skulls.
  o	Now the ending condition code is sectioned into two parts to avoid this issue. The ending will only run once the player has collected all the bones and the skull, as intended.

Improvements (of existing features)
	Fencing borders have been added to the graveyard to clarify game space.
	The mausoleum door looks more like a door now.
	Changed the coffin design and color to appear more like a coffin that is interactable.
	The plaque outside of fence locking in the skull now clarifies the need for a key to enter.
